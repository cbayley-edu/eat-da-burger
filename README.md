## Installation 

[
  You can immediately access the app using the link above but you can also run the application locally.

  Using GitHub, clone or fork the repository. You'll need to get the repo pulled to your local repository. Once you have the repo locally, be sure to run npm install from your terminal to install inquirer and all other dependencies for the application.

  If you plan to push the repo back to your GitHub repo, be sure to add a .gitignore file to your root folder and ignore node_modules and .DS_Store/ .
